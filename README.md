#### A TODO LIST web app using React & Redux

**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Prerequisites**
This project template was built with *Create React App*, which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

Projects built with Create-React-App include support for ES6 syntax, as well as several unofficial / not-yet-final forms of Javascript syntax such as Class Properties and JSX. See the list of language features and polyfills supported by Create-React-App for more information.

**Installing**
download or clone the repository then `npm install`.

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
